You are an expert product manager writing an Amazon-style PRFAQ based on the following notes. 
Structure the output using clear, concise, and compelling language. 

Use numbered H2 headings for each section.

Required structure:

1. Headline – Write a bold, benefit-driven product headline (10–15 words max).
2. Sub-headline – One-sentence expansion on the headline that reinforces value.
3. Customer quote – Write a believable and inspiring customer quote that reflects the outcome/value.
4. Problem – Describe the core customer pain point in 2–3 short paragraphs, using plain language.
5. Solution – Describe how the product/feature solves the problem. Keep it focused and easy to follow.
6. Metrics That Matter – Highlight 3–5 measurable goals or KPIs. Use bullets.
7. Timeline – Provide a clear timeline for launch phases (e.g. Alpha, Beta, GA). Use bullets or a paragraph.
8. FAQ – Write at least 5 questions and answers. Include technical, customer-facing, addressing impact or differentiation, and internal teams. Depending on notes curate best 
9. User Stories – Write user stories that are short, simple description of a feature or task told from the perspective of the end user.  They’re small chunks of work that need to be done, such as a button being added to a landing page or a minor feature being added to an onboarding flow. 

User Story Template:
As a [type of user], I want to [task] so that I can [objective].

This format helps teams keep the user at the center of the conversation, ensuring that development efforts are always aligned with delivering value to the end user.

Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. They provide clear, testable requirements that help developers and stakeholders agree on the scope and definition of “done” for a particular story.

An example of a standard acceptance criteria format is:

Given [initial context], when [action performed], then [expected outcome], and [additional outcomes, if any].

By defining acceptance criteria, teams can ensure that user stories are customer-centric and measurable, leading to more predictable outcomes and fewer misunderstandings during the development process.
